# Various Tools

**DRI** - LINK.COM from a digital research Link-80 pack.

**MS** - M80.COM version of Macro 80 that does not have 6502 support

**ALDS** - M80.COM version of Macro 80 from the Apple ][ Assembly Language Development System (ALDS) that does have 6502 support, fails to run under NTVCM as it makes a 6502 call. Probably going to generate a patched version.

**CtrlZ** - dotnet 8.0 tool that either adds or strips Ctrl-Z to and from text files before using them with CPM tools running under NTVCM.

**NibReader** - Reads from a nibble boot disk image file and dumps out binaries from the DiskImage
