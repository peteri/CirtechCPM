# Various Tools

**DRI** - `LINK.COM` from a digital research Link-80 pack.

**MS** - `M80.COM` version of Macro 80 that does not have 6502 support

**ALDS** - `M80.COM` version of Macro 80 from the Apple ][ Assembly Language Development System (ALDS) that does have 6502 support, fails to run under NTVCM as it makes a 6502 call. There is a patched version called `M80P.COM` which supports 6502 code, it REQUIRES a Z80 which is why the check is in place.

**CtrlZ** - dotnet 8.0 tool that either adds or strips Ctrl-Z to and from text files before using them with CP/M tools running under NTVCM.

**NibReader** - Reads from a nibble boot disk image file and dumps out binaries from the DiskImage. Writes out the binaries from the boot track and the CPM3 image.

**CPM3SYSDump** - Dump out the `CPM3.SYS` file generated by NibReader to the console as a hex dump with high byte characters (used for direct Apple screen writes) mapped to low byte
