# Cirtech CP/M plus disassembly.
Analysis of the Cirtech Apple //e CP/M plus code, basically the repo where I add
various disk images and disassemblies while I work on the code. Currently the disk images do NOT boot
in eiher mame or AppleWin this is the first thing to fix.

## Why?
Well I'd like to port CP/M plus to the RC2014 system. With most of the source code being available 
via [The Unoffical CP/M Web site](http://www.cpm.z80.de/) along with various bits of build process
this feels like an achievable aim.

As an initial host system I'd like to use the Cirtech CP/M plus system running in an emulator to act as a build environment.
This should mean once completed the build process can be self hosted on a RC2014 system.

## Copyrights
Any code that I generate will be MIT licensed.
The remaining code is either copyrighted by Cirtech Ltd or Digital Research Inc (or their successors). 
Hopefully this won't cause any issues, but I do not have permission for the Cirtech code (see the Unofficial CP/M website for the DRI code).
