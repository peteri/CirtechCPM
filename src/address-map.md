# Cirtech Apple //e address map

The Cirtech CP/M card uses a 74LS288 PROM for it's address mapping from the Z80 side to the 6502 side. I managed to find this [page](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/patrick/schematics.htm) by Dr. Patrick SchÃ¤fer which has a schematic for the Apple //c version of the //e card I have (the link is at the bottom of the page).

The address map on the schematic is incomplete.

The CP/M plus software has checks in the BIOS for the address mapping, when calling from the Z80 side it uses a different address for the write that swaps to the Z80 side.

In order to test this on real hardware, some Z80 code was written to save 16 values from the memory stepping by `1000H` increments. The code then overwrites these locations with a value where both nibbles are the same as the 4K page.

The first value chosen was with an offset of `$C6EA` or `0E6EAH` which happens to contain the value `EE`. When this was run with transferring to the 6502 side by writes to `E400`, `E401`, `E402` and `E403` the map from Z80->6502 addresses didn't change. A picture of the screen after running is shown below:

This showed that for this particular variant of the Cirtech card the address used to swap between the Z80 and 6502 processors didn't matter.

Then addresses used to test for the prescence of the card in the BIOS happen to have the address line A11 high, so the test address was changed to have A11 high which then showed the following address map.

![Second test run](../images/A11HighMapping.jpg)

Addresses in the range `07800H`-`07FFFH` and `09800H`-`09FFFH` from the Z80 side are swapped by the 74LS288 32 byte PROM when A11 is high.

It seems possible the different card address writes for E401 etc are for a different card than the Apple //e card which gives the same address mapping effect.
