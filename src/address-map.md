# Cirtech Apple //e address map

The Cirtech CP/M card uses a 74LS288 PROM for it's address mapping from the Z80 side to the 6502 side. I managed to find this [page](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/patrick/schematics.htm) by Dr. Patrick Sch√§fer which has a schematic for the Apple //c version of the //e card I have (the link is at the bottom of the page).

The address map on the schematic is incomplete.
